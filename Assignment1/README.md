I have built and debugged this code on node-js.

How to call the program? If you want to run the program with some input string (let's denote it by {input}) then we need to write the following command on your terminal:
	node assignment1.js {input}

This code works for all kind of input strings, with or without spaces in between.

The output is in 3 lines:
The first line will show your hexadecimal value that starts with 5 zeros. The second line shows the value that has to be appended after the input string in order to get the desired output. The third line shows the program execuion time.

P.S the html file has no real purpose in the demonstration of this code and can be ignored without problem.
